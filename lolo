// "Here's my comment for the the assignment for the coding above, I would like to explaing
my code. I generally created a table in order to make an automatic table and a data searc.
The first thing I created is the webpage and imported the data from the start-up code'
After doing that I created a table , <table> and made a new var called data and put the information  of
it in. Secondly I named the the different columns what the assignment as for but It was very hard to
differentiate which data went in one or the other. Lastly, I created an auto search for datetime.
This assignment was somewhat hard, and I tried my best to figure, it was very interesting working with these 
data types but generally I feel like it was somewhat hard".
